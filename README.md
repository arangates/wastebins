##WHAT IS IT ?

WasteBin is an intelligent waste-management system for smartcities which helps the city corporation to collect wastes easily and efficiently.internet of things based solution which provides the optimized way of collecting and managing the Garbages of city by using data fetched from its network of micro wireless sensors present inside bins.Using sensor network sends data to WasteBin servers to work out if the containers are full or not, and when they should be emptied

##HOW IT WORKS ??
All the wastebins are remotely configurable,Geographically locatable and provide waste levels of bins,temperature and more.

Sensors communicate over the wifi network then via the internet to smartbin secure cloud post the bin data in wastebin live portal, from here the user monitor and manage their full portfolio of asserts and get complete business intelligence package one online platform and accessible from anywhere and anytime

##WHAT IT PROVIDES ???

The wastebin live web application is very easy to use and feature-rich a powerful all in one platform for managing your asserts with features including geo map views showing realtime status of asserts and drill-down performance details on each asserts and key performance indication and benchmarks,powerful backend that generates reports for your application

The proposed idea comes with a standalone progressive webapp featuring the 

##FIXING DOUBLE-TROUBLE :

The intelligent algorithm computes the shortest route between the filled bins and proposes a Modus Operandi that the driver should adopt on the particular day, which is accessible on the dashboard.Thus avoiding unfilled bins,high traffic routes and saving time,fuel and energy indeed.
