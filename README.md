# Wastebins 

##WHAT IS IT ?

WasteBin is an intelligent waste-management system for smartcities which helps the city corporation to collect wastes easily and efficiently without any hassels.It is an internet of things based solution which provides the optimized way of collecting and managing the Garbages of city by using data fetched from sensor mesh networking present inside bins.All the wastebins are remotely configurable,Geographically locatable and provide waste levels of bins,temperature and more.

##HOW IT WORKS ??

The data fetched from Sensor Networks is sent to centralized web server where it is processed to 


##WHAT IT PROVIDES ???

The proposed idea comes with a standalone progressive webapp featuring Real-time tracking of levels of wastes in bins and Providing location of bins in map view 

###FIXING DOUBLE-TROUBLE :

The intelligent algorithm computes the shortest route between the filled bins and proposes a Modus Operandi that the driver should adopt on the particular day, which is accessible on the dashboard.Thus avoiding unfilled bins,high traffic routes and saving time,fuel and energy indeed.
